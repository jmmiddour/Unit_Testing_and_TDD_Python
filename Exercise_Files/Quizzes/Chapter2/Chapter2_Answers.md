4. What are the three phases of Test Driven Development?

    A. Red, Green, and Refactor

    - **Correct!** In the Red phase, you implement a failing unit test.  In the Green phase, you make it pass. In the refactor phase, you modify the production code, and the test to remove duplication and make the code clean.

    B. Test, Code, and Release

    - ***Incorrect.*** The three phases are Red, Green, Refactor. In the Red phase, you implement a failing unit test. In the Green phase, you make it pass. In the refactor phase, you modify the production code, and the test to remove duplication and make the code clean.

    C. User Stories, Tests, and Coding

    - ***Incorrect.*** The three phases are Red, Green, Refactor. In the Red phase, you implement a failing unit test. In the Green phase, you make it pass. In the refactor phase, you modify the production code, and the test to remove duplication and make the code clean.
